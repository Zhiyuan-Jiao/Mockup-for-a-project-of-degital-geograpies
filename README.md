# Mockup-for-a-project-of-degital-geograpies

## 1. Introduction

Mockups are essential for the design process at the early stage of a project as they give viewers an idea of how the final product will appear, and the implementation of interactive elements like buttons and icons also hints at the function. With a well-made sample in front of their eyes, stakeholders don’t have to rely so much on their imaginations. So, in this lab, we are going to learn how to use one of the most famous browser-based UI and UX design applications Figma to create mockups for a project.

The project we are designing the mockup for is called **Damron Guide: Seattle**, it is a website utilizing online maps to visually explore the Damron’s Travel Guide which specifies the spatial pattern and temporal changes of the LGBT related places. Especially, The evolving space of LGBTQ life in Seattle in the past five decades. For more information, you could visit this web site (check [here](https://damron.com/about-us)).

In this mockup, we will walk through the whole design process of the main GUI including the basemap, venues,  layer switcher, timeline and info panel. Then, we will add in some hover over functions, and finally give a brief intro to how to design user interfaces other than the desktop GUI, such as the mobile GUI.

## 3. Design Mockup

### 3.1 Main GUI

In this section, we will design the main user interface. We will need to firstly create a new page, then, add in the base map, venues inside the page. Finally, we could incorporate some other map features into the page such as the zoom button, map layer selection, timeline, heatmap toggle, and info panel. 

### New file

In this part, we will create a new file with the common desktop screen size presets. 

1. Click the Plus sign at the top right of the page to create a new file.

2. In the template window, under Blank Presets, check Desktop with default size of 1440 x 1024 as it is one of the most common screen sizes today.
